Version: 2.5.0 (Build 1)

Short notes for App Review team

App: Koran Pariwisata Indonesia — a native reading app focused on Indonesian tourism news. This is not a simple content aggregator; it includes several on-device native features to manage reading and offline usage.

Key native features (visible in Menu / Dashboard):
- Local storage (SQLite): offline articles, bookmarks, in-app notes, and collections.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) with text highlighting while reading aloud.
- Reading statistics and daily goals on the Dashboard.
- In-app notes editor and local sync (no account required).
- Dark mode, share, and onboarding that highlights these native functions.

Reproduction steps for the "News" screen (to validate the fix):
1. Open the app.
2. From Menu, tap the "Berita" (News) card or the "Berita Terkini" banner.
3. The app will immediately show cached articles (if available). If no cache exists you will see shimmer placeholders while the app fetches new data.
4. The app uses per-request timeouts; if server responses are very slow the UI shows a "Retry" button after ~12 seconds.

Notes about this release (v2.5.0):
- Fixes included: parallel image fetching, per-request timeouts, offline-first behavior (show cache first, then refresh), and a watchdog timeout that replaces an indefinite spinner with a retry UI.
- These changes address a previous App Review report where tapping "Berita" could display an indefinite spinner on slow/unstable network conditions.

No login is required. If you need additional reproduction steps (TTS demo, notes edit, or statistics), or device logs from a specific device/OS (e.g., iPad Air on iPadOS 26.0.1), we can provide them immediately.
