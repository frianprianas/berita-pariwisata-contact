Version: 2.5.0 (Build 1)

Short notes for Google Play Review / QA

App: Koran Pariwisata Indonesia — native reading app focused on Indonesian tourism news. This app is not a passive aggregator; it includes on-device features to manage reading and offline usage.

Key native features (visible in Menu / Dashboard):
- Local storage (SQLite): offline articles, bookmarks, in-app notes, and collections.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) with text highlighting while reading aloud.
- Reading statistics and daily goals on the Dashboard.
- In-app notes editor with local sync (no account required).
- Dark mode, share, and onboarding that highlights these native features.

Simple test steps for the "News/Berita" screen:
1. Install the app (upload AAB to Play Console > Internal testing / closed track) or install the APK directly on a device.
2. Open the app and tap the "Berita" (News) card from the Menu.
3. If previously viewed articles exist, they display immediately from local cache. If not, shimmer placeholders appear while fresh data loads.
4. The app employs per-request timeouts and a watchdog: on extremely slow networks a "Retry" button appears after about 12 seconds.

Notes about this release:
- Fixes in v2.5.0: parallel image fetching, per-request timeouts, offline-first behavior (show cache first then refresh), and watchdog timeout to avoid indefinite spinner.
- These changes address an earlier report where tapping "Berita" could leave the UI stuck on a spinner under very slow server responses.
